# Scaffolding

This mod aims to implement Minecrafts scaffolding into Vintage Story!

Currently this mod adds:

- A scaffolding block that is climbable and passthrough
- Easy construction and destruction just like Minecrafts 

What I would like to add:

- Customize maximum stability to allow for longer/shorter bridges
- Translations
- Better visuals. Especially for bridges
